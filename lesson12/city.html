          While there is still some debate on when they city of Cusco’s history
          began (and certainly much evidence we do not yet know of), evidence
          proves that it dates as far back as 1000 B.C. Organized life in Cusco
          city began when the Marcavalle culture was the dominant power,
          sometime around this time. A population made up of farmers and
          shepherds, the city was precariously organized and mainly took up the
          eastern side of modern Cusco. Cusco’s second phase of habitation began
          around 800 B.C., when the Chapanata culture developed within the city.
          By 600 A.C., the Qotakalli culture was created: with it came the first
          established system of Regional States.

      <h2>Inca History: 1200-1532 A.D.</h2>
      <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
          Inca civilization began in Cusco around 1200 A.D., with the very first
          Inka: Manko Capaq and Mama Ocllo. Elaborating greatly on previous life
          in Cusco, the Incas built what we now know as Cusco city. It was
          divided into two sectors, the urin and hanan, each arranged to include
          two of the four provinces (also known as suyos, representing the
          northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast quarters).
        </p>
        <p>
          While we know that the Incas built Cusco city, one of the biggest
          mysteries today is how. It is unknown how the large stones were
          gathered and transported to the site, or how they managed to build
          with techniques so far advanced for their time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this initial foundation of Cusco, the Inca city went into a
          second period of growth around 1400. Archaeological evidence suggests
          gradual growth before the rule of Pachacuti, however the Inca history
          of Cusco states that King Pachacuti led this expansive phase, the
          start of his transformation of Cusco from sleepy city-state to vast
          empire of Tawantinsuyu. Many believed the new layout of the city was
          planned as an effigy, distinctively in the shape of a puma, a sacred
          animal in Inca culture. The fortress of Saksaywaman formed the head,
          the plaza of Huacaypata the navel, and the converging Huatanay and
          Tullumayo Rivers as the tail.

      <h2>Spanish Invasion of Cusco</h2>
      <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
          The turning point in the history of Cusco was the transfer from Inca
          to Spanish rule. The first Spaniards arrived to the city on November
          15th, 1533. On March 23rd 1534, Francisco Pizzaro refounded Cusco for
          the Spanish King.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pizarro ceremoniously made Manco Inca the new Peruvian leader. A long
          and bloody war against the Spanish conquistadores began, lasting until
          1572 when Tupaq Amaru I, the last emperor of the Inca dynasty was
          defeated, captured and executed in the city’s main square. The Spanish
          subsequently destroyed the many remaining structures in the city of
          Cusco, leaving little more than the foundations of some (which they
          then used for building their own churches and buildings).
        </p>
        <p>
          A rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II began in 1780, setting another
          significant precedent against the Spanish Regime. Betrayed, defeated
          and executed in the main square of Cusco, his actions did not go
          unnoticed. Mateo Pumacahua and the Angulo Brothers initiated another
          rebellion between 1814 and 1815.
